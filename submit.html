<h2> Call for Papers </h2>

    We shall accept submissions of up to 8 pages of content (with no limit on references and supplementary material) that have not been previously accepted at an archival venue (such as ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR). While up to 8 pages of content is allowed, we strongly encourage authors to limit their submission to 4-6 pages, to ensure higher quality reviewer feedback. Papers should be anonymized for double blind review.

    <b> Topics of Interest </b>. We will encourage discussions and contributions around (but not limited to) the following topics that are important in the context of reward-free RL:
</p>
<ul>
    <li> Reward-Free Task Specification: Learning from  preferences, language, cross-embodiment, social constraints, safety, demonstrations, implicit human feedback. </li>
    <li> Utilizing large-scale reward-free data: Learning representations, skills, from video, and novel datasets. </li>
    <li> Utilizing foundational models for efficient adaptation/finetuning.</li>
    <li> Using reward-free interactions: exploration, sample efficiency, unsupervised skill learning, self-supervised objectives, goal-conditioning, and model learning for RL. </li>
</ul>

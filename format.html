<h3>"Poster" Sessions</h3>
<div class="break"></div>
<p>For each paper being presented at the workshop, we will host spaces for posters to be presented in person.</p>
<!-- <p>The Zoom meeting rooms will be open only during the poster session timeslots (see the <a href="/schedule.html">Schedule</a>), during which authors will join the meeting rooms to allow you to ask them questions face-to-face. We encourage you to first watch the presentation associated with the paper, and then join the Zoom meeting room to ask questions and engage in further discussion.</p>
</div> -->

<!-- <div class="row">
<h3>Meet and Greet</h3>
<div class="break"></div>
<p>To try to replicate the in-person aspect of workshops, we are hosting a virtual meet-and-greet. This is based on the <a href="https://neuromatch.io/instructions">Neuromatch "mind-matching" model</a>. Sign ups are now closed.</p>
<p>We will match participants with up to three other people (four total) who have similar interests and who can meet during the same 30-minute timeslot. Then, we will set up a videochat meeting for you to meet and talk about whatever you would like!</p>
